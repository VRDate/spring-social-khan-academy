spring-social-khan-academy
==========================

Spring Social implementation of the Khan Academy API.

Khan Academy API uses OAUTH2 for its authentication - so far this project handles the OAUTH dance and then exposes two basic calls to the user API - fetch the basic profile details and another to fetch list of user attempted exercises.

Still a lot more of the API to expose (videos, playlists, badges, etc).
